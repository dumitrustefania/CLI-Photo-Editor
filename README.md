# CLI Photo Editor

## General description and notes:

*) All the pixels of the image are stored as dinamically alocated matrices,
using malloc() and free() functions from the stdlib.h library.

*) I defined the datatype 'image', that contains all the necessary information
about the loaded image, including the dinamically allocated matrices of pixels.

*) I defined the structure 'filter_values' that stores the kernel values
of the filters that can be applied.

*) There are 8 possible commands that can be recieved from input:

- LOAD <file> - Load the image from the given file into memory
- SELECT ALL - Select the whole image
- SELECT <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> - Select a portion of the image, situated between
							   the given indices
- CROP - Crop the selection, keeping the new smaller image
- ROTATE <angle> - Rotate the selection with given angle
- APPLY <filter> - Apply one of the filters to the selection
- SAVE <file> [ascii] - Save the selection into a plain / ascii file
- EXIT - Free the allocated memory and exit the program

## Commands:

1) LOAD <file>
	- free the memory of the previously loaded image, if it exists
	- store all the information located in the header about the new image
		(magic word, width, height, max value)
	- allocate memory for the pixel matrices (1 matrix for grayscale / 
		3 matrices for RGB)
	- using the magic word, decide whether the image is stored as plain or binary
		and read the values accordingly
	- store the value of each pixel in the specific matrices
		(gray/red/green/blue)
	- select the whole image

2) SELECT ALL
	- select the whole image
	- same as 'SELECT 0 0 img->width img->height'

3) SELECT <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>
	- check if the coordinates are valid
	- memorise the selection

4) CROP
	- allocate memory for a temporary matrix that will 
		represent the cropped channel
	- crop each channel based on the given selection and store
		the values in the specific temporary matrix
	- free memory of the old channel
	- allocate memory for the new channel that will have a smaller no. of pixels
	- save the values from the temporary matrix
	- free the memory for the temporary matrix

5) ROTATE <angle>
	- check if angle is a valid integer
	- rotate the selection for each channel to the right until
		meeting the desired angle
		I. if the selection is not equal to the whole matrix:
			-  allocate memory for a temporary matrix that stores
				the rotated selection
			- update the values in the selection to the new ones
			- frees the temporary matrix
		II. if the selection is equal to the whole matrix:
			-  allocate memory for a temporary matrix that stores
				the rotated image
			- free the memory for the given channel with dimesions w x h
			- allocate memory for the channel with dimensions h x w
			- set the values in the channel to the new ones
			- free the temporary matrix
			* after each image rotation make sure to change the width & height
				of the image and select all of it

6) APPLY <filter> 
	- apply one of the filters: EDGE, SHARPEN, BLUR, GAUSSIAN BLUR
	- allocate new matrices for each color channel (RGB), which will
		initially have the elements of the selection 
	- compute the kernel sum for each pixel, then save the sum as
		the new pixel value
	- update the value for the pixels in selection to the new filtered ones
	- free the temporary matrices

7) SAVE <file> [ascii]
	- read the file where the image should be saved
	- check whether keyword 'ascii' is present => image will be saved
		as plain; otherwise, image will be saved as binary
	- save the new magic word and the image's header in the file
	- save the pixel values for each channel, either as plain or binary
	- close the files

8) EXIT
	- free the memory for the loaded image, if it exists
	- stop the program
